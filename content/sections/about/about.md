My name is Jae Young Seo. I am a Computer Science and Mathematics with an emphasis on Statistics double major attending Vassar College. I'm most interested in full-stack development but open to exploring other career paths. I am seeking Summer 2023 internship opportunities to gain the valuable experience I need to grow in the ever-changing tech world.
