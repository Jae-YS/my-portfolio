I am a Computer Science and Mathematics with an emphasis on Statistics double major attending Vassar College. I am currently a sophomore interested in full-stack development or backend development, but open to exploring other career paths. I am seeking Summer 2023 internship opportunities to gain the valuable experience I need to grow in the ever-changing tech world.
 
Some fun facts about me!
 
I am on the Division III Vassar Men's Track and Field team. My best and favorite event is the 110mH, but I also run the short sprints and relay. Additionally, I am a part of a few clubs at my school: VC++, Vassar Hunger Action, Student Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC), and Asian Student Association (ASA). My favorite hobby that stuck with me for countless years is solving the Rubik's cube. Officially, my 3x3 personal best to this date is 11.37 at Weston Spring 2016!
